# The Spaghetti License :spaghetti:

## Introduction

Since I've began using a computer, I've been "agreeing" to the kilometric blurbs software is bundled with way too often, without really understanding what they mean (or even trying in case of EULAs). It's true that English is not my native tongue, but why should such complicated terminology be used? Can't we express the same, common meaning with more ease?

I find this frustrating.

One day I came across the [SUSHI-WARE](https://github.com/MakeNowJust/sushi-ware) license: while I was struck by MakeNowJust's effort, I was a bit underwhelmed by the sushi part. Don't get me wrong, I like Japanese food but my Italian DNA absolutely demands some spaghetti: al sugo, con parmigiano e **al dente**.

Thus, the [Spaghetti license](LICENSE) was born.

> The SUSHI-WARE license is a derivative of the [BEER-WARE](https://people.freebsd.org/~phk/) license. 

## Applying

Following [MakeNowJust](https://github.com/MakeNowJust)'s footsteps I also created this nice badge (a fascinating process indeed...) you can include in your documentation or `README.md`, by copying the following:
